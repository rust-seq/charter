# Overview

`rust-seq` is a distributed project that aims to organize and align the broader
community towards building a _better_ foundation upon which the next-generation
of omics tooling can be developed. This is accomplished by a few distinct but
related initiatives:

- Creating the `rust-seq` stack: a collection of community-developed libraries
  and tooling (written in Rust) that are collaboratively developed to provide a
  high-quality, synergistic foundation for omics-based analysis tools.
- Developing asyncronous mechanisms for identifying gaps in the ecosystem and
  facilitating community discussion around those gaps (e.g., "what crates _need_
  to exist but don't yet?").
- Providing infrastructure for the development of this high-quality foundation
  (e.g., common continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines that can be
  leveraged by tool authors).
- Improving awareness of ongoing efforts generally within the community via
  common discussion channels (i.e., the [`rust-seq` Zulip chat] and the
  [`rust-seq` GitHub discussions]).
