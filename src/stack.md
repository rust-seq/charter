# The `rust-seq` Stack

The `rust-seq` stack is developed in a distributed manner. This means that
some crates will be available on the [`rust-seq` GitHub], while others may be
available under different organizations.

However, we will seek to have an up-to-date list of relevant crates related to
the `rust-seq` effort within the [`rust-seq` registry].
