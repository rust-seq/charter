# Checklist

If you're an author of a crate within the `rust-seq` stack _or_ you would like
to be, you can use the following checklist to ensure that your crates meet the
above values. For each value, recommendations are listed roughly in order of
most preferrable to least. Note that these are just suggestions to adhere to the
values aboveâ€”completing every item is not a requirement to ratify a particular
crate.

To learn more about any particular value, please see [this
link](../get-started/values).

### Correctness

- [x] Write comprehensive tests to check that all invariants are upheld in the
      crate's logic (these also serve as documentation for your code!).
- [x] If you are returning user-facing errors, consider using the
      [`anyhow`](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow) crate. Most importantly,
      this means (a) returning `anyhow::Result` for your `fn main()`, and (b) using the
      [`context()`](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/trait.Context.html#tymethod.context)
      method to add additional context wherever errors might occur.
- [x] Ensure that all errors implement
      [`std::error::Error`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html)
      and that the information returned by
      [`std::fmt::Display`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html)
      is helpful. This ensures your custom error types will work well with the
      broader Rust ecosystem.
- [x] Use the `debug_assert!` macro throughout your code to plant sanity checks
      within the code. Note that this imposes no performance hits for
      production-compiled code (`cargo build --release`), as these statements
      are not included in these builds.
- [x] If your crate handles user input, integrate a fuzzing suite within your
      tests (e.g., with [`cargo-fuzz`](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz)).

### Performant

- [x] Provide benchmarks that utilize a benchmarking framework (e.g.,
      [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) or
      [Divian](https://github.com/nvzqz/divan)) that continuous measure
      performance in the CI and track regressions.
- [x] For each data type you expect to be heavily used by users, measure the
      amount of memory the type takes up and either via (a) anonymous constants or
      (b) unit tests, ensure that the memory required for that data type remains
      constant.

### Contributable

- [x] Ensure your crate is **comprehensively tested** to ensure that code can be
      modified and refactored by non-experts with confidence.
- [x] Ensure your crate is **comprehensively linted** to ensure that code is of the
      highest quality possible.
- [x] Ensure your crate is **comprehensively documented** to ensure that using
      the code is clear and straightforward. This means (a) ensuring
      documentation for all public-facing code, (b) ensuring documentation for
      all private code [to ease development in those areas], and (c) including
      examples for any user-facing code to make sure usage is straightforward.
      Note that this can be accomplished largely by enabling the
      [`missing_docs`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/builtin/static.MISSING_DOCS.html),
      [`clippy::missing_docs_in_private_items`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#/missing_docs_in_private_items),
      and
      [`rustdoc::missing_doc_code_examples`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nightly-rustc/rustdoc/lint/static.MISSING_DOC_CODE_EXAMPLES.html)
      lints.

### Cross-platform

- [x] Ensure that you use `cfg!()` statements to handle the needs of different
      operating system environments where the code might run.
- [x] Ensure that your code compiles and passes all of the CI checks across the
      three major operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux).

### Stable

- [x] Ensure your crate follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and
      that you don't introduce breaking changes to your API without incrementing the
      major version number.

### Broadly Usable

- [x] Ensure that your code is available under [one of the licenses outlined in
      the values section](/docs/get-started/values#broadly-usable).
