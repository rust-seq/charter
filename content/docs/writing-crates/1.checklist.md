# Checklist

If you're an author of a crate within the `rust-seq` stack _or_ you would like
to be, you can use the following checklist to ensure that your crates meet the
above values. Note that these are just suggestions to adhere to the values
aboveâ€”completing every item is not a requirement to ratify a particular crate.

## Performance

- [x] Provide benchmarks that utilize a benchmarking framework (e.g.,
      [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) or
      [Divian](https://github.com/nvzqz/divan)) that continuous measure
      performance in the CI and track regressions.
